Lots of stuff.  Code base almost completely overhauled with much help from www.sdltutorials.com.  Lots more work to 
come, as some things are still very rough.  

Completed:

- removed necessity of "global" file
- changed from "level" class to "game" class
- almost completely changed code base to a more OOP approach
- switched from "functions" class to "graphics" class
- completion of "entity" class

To do:

- creation of "letter" and "letterspace" classes derived from "entity" class
- re-add collision detection
- word completion
- more descriptive commenting
- removal of old, commented out code
- more than could possibly be listed
